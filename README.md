Project Title: Short Game

Project Description: 

We will create a rock paper scissor game which will contain images of three hands, rock, paper and scissors. The user can play the game against the server or against another player. Once the user selects the opponent, the game will begin and the user can select any of the three images to play in each round. There will be a total of three rounds. Winner of each round will be decided by the program. The winner of the game will be decided through a best of three process. 


Function Requirements:

            1. There is a begin button on the first screen.
            2. When the user clicks the begin button, the user is prompted to select whether to play against the computer or another player. 
            3. If the user selects to play with another player, then both players needs to write down their names.
            4. If the user selects to play with the computer, then the player enters their own name.
            5. After clicking next, the rules of the game are shown to the user.
            6. For each round the users have to select an image containing the three hands of rock, paper or scissors.
            7. When the user or both players select the hand and clicks on confirm, the hand of the computer or another player is shown.
            8. Then the user is alerted the winner of the round.
            9. There is a scoreboard on the screen, stating the score of the two players.
            10. There is a total of three rounds.
            11. Whoever wins at least two of the rounds is the winner of the game. 
            12. The user is prompted whether he won or lost at the end of the game.
            13. Then two buttons appear stating "play again" and "end."
            14. Clicking on "play again" leads the user to the start menu again.
            15. Clicking on "end" ends the session and a screen showing the credits appears.
