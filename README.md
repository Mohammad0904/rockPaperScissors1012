Project Title: Short Game

Project Description: 

We will create a rock paper scissor game which will contain images of three hands, rock, paper and scissors. The user can play the game against the server or against another player. Once the user selects the opponent, the game will begin and the user can select any of the three images to play in each round. There will be a total of three rounds. Winner of each round will be decided by the program. The winner of the game will be decided through a best of three process. 


Function Requirements:

            1. There will be a begin button on the first screen.
            2. When the user clicks the begin button, the user will be prompted to select whether to play against the computer or another player. 
            3. If the user selects to play with another player, then both players will need to write down their names.
            4. If the user selects to play with the computer, then the player will enter their own name.
            5. At first, the users will be alerted regarding the rules of the game.
            6. For each round the users have to select an image containing the three hands of rock, paper or scissors.
            7. When the user selects the hand, the hand of the computer or another player will be shown.
            8. Then the user will be alerted the winner of the round.
            9. There will be a scoreboard on the screen, stating the score of the two players.
            10. There will be a total of three rounds.
            11. Whoever wins at least two of the rounds will be the winner of the game. 
            12. The user will be prompted whether he won or lost.
            13. Then two buttons will appear stating "play again" and "end."
            14. Clicking on "play again" will lead the user to the start menu again.
            15. Clicking on "end" will end the session and a screen showing the credits will appear.
